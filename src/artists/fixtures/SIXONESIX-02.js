Constantinos - A.K.A. Sixonesix – is well known for getting the crowds moving and grooving as a resident DJ at Limassol’s Sousami bar. But he also knows how to get the party going at pretty much any venue when he’s busy behind the decks. Fueled by a wild passion for world music and distorted guitar sounds, as well as an unconditional love for vinyl records, you can expect disco, house and techno in the mix.
